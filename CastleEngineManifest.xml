  This file allows to build LSP server using CGE build tool,
  https://castle-engine.io/build_tool ,
  like "castle-engine compile" on the command-line.

  Note that LSP server uses LCL CodeTools package,
  as such it must be compiled by lazbuild (build_using_lazbuild="true")
  and most of the compilation parameters are actually delegated to
  the pasls.lpi file.
  CGE build tool mostly just calls lazbuild.
